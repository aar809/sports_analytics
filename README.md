### Abstract
Tennis has consistently been one of the most popular sports in the world, but efforts to push the sport into the age of advanced data analytics have lagged far behind other popular sports, such as basketball, football, and baseball. Although many recent works have pushed the envelope in the right direction to accurately predict match outcomes for tennis players, data availability for lower-tiered players still remains to be a major roadblock to generate insightful predictions. Building on top of previous research work done by Dong et al., our goal is to take the existing concepts of PCSP and PAT model checker, and attempt to expand the access to lower-tiered players through a concept we call data generalization by clustering. To test the effectiveness of our approach, we first cluster players based on play style using three distinct game components: Service game, Return game, and Rally game. Next, we employ a 3-step iterative experimental process to select the most optimal feature sets, and clustering algorithms and then evaluate the results using metrics such as intra-inter cluster distance, evaluation against a controlled feature set, and finally PCSP player-cluster replacement.
